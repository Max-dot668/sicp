![SICP](image/Nagato_Yuki_Bandaged_Hand_SICP.png)

This repository is my personal learning space for the **Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs (SICP)** book by Harold Abelson and Gerald Jay Sussman.  

I am using this repository to:  

- Work through the **exercises** in each chapter (found in `chapters/`).  
- Complete the **projects** from the book (found in `projects/`).  
- Keep all my **notes and code** organized in one place.  
- Practice **Scheme programming** and improve my overall programming skills.
